# Audio Recognition with Deep Learning

## Overview

This project aims to build a deep learning model for audio recognition tasks, specifically focusing on the classification of environmental sounds. The model is trained to recognize various sound events such as dog barks, car horns, and doorbells. The project utilizes deep learning techniques and the Librosa library for feature extraction.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Librosa
- NumPy
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/audio-recognition-deep-learning.git
cd audio-recognition-deep-learning
```

2. Download the dataset and place it in the `data` directory.

3. Run the training script:

```
python train.py
```

4. Evaluate the model:

```
python evaluate.py
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the UrbanSound8K dataset, which contains 8732 labeled sound excerpts (<=4s) of urban sounds from 10 classes. Each class contains 1000 sound excerpts. The dataset is provided in WAV format and is available for download from [here](http://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html).

## Methodology

The audio recognition model is implemented using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. Raw audio signals are converted into Mel spectrograms, which serve as input features to the CNN. The model architecture consists of several convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with a categorical cross-entropy loss function.

## Results

The trained model achieves an accuracy of 85% on the validation set. The confusion matrix and classification report are provided in the `results` directory.

## Future Work

- Experiment with different deep learning architectures (e.g., recurrent neural networks).
- Explore data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.
- Deploy the model as a real-time audio recognition system.
